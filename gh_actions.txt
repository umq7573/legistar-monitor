# GitHub Actions: Command-Line Management Guide

This guide provides concise instructions for managing GitHub Actions workflows using the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

---

1. Installation & Authentication

---

* Install GitHub CLI: [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)
* Authenticate:

  ```
  gh auth login
  ```

---

2. List Workflow Runs

---

* List recent runs:

  ```
  gh run list
  ```
* Filter by workflow file:

  ```
  gh run list --workflow <workflow_file.yml>
  ```
* Filter by branch or status:

  ```
  gh run list --branch <branch> --status <status>
  ```

---

3. Trigger a Workflow

---

* Trigger a workflow with workflow\_dispatch:

  ```
  gh workflow run <workflow_file.yml>
  ```
* Specify a branch/tag:

  ```
  gh workflow run <workflow_file.yml> --ref <branch_or_tag>
  ```
* Pass input parameters:

  ```
  gh workflow run <workflow_file.yml> -f key=value
  ```

---

4. View Run Details & Logs

---

* View details:

  ```
  gh run view <run_id>
  ```
* View logs:

  ```
  gh run view <run_id> --log
  ```
* Open in browser:

  ```
  gh run view <run_id> --web
  ```

---

5. Rerun Workflows

---

* Rerun entire workflow:

  ```
  gh run rerun <run_id>
  ```
* Rerun only failed jobs:

  ```
  gh run rerun <run_id> --failed
  ```

---

6. Cancel Workflow Runs

---

* Cancel a run:

  ```
  gh run cancel <run_id>
  ```

---

7. Monitor Workflow Progress

---

* Watch until completion:

  ```
  gh run watch <run_id>
  ```
* Exit with status:

  ```
  gh run watch <run_id> --exit-status
  ```

---

8. Download Artifacts

---

* Download artifacts:

  ```
  gh run download <run_id>
  ```
* Specify download directory:

  ```
  gh run download <run_id> --dir <path>
  ```

---

9. View Workflow Definition

---

* View workflow details:

  ```
  gh workflow view <workflow_file.yml>
  ```
* View YAML:

  ```
  gh workflow view <workflow_file.yml> --yaml
  ```

---

10. Delete Workflow Runs

---

* Delete a run:

  ```
  gh run delete <run_id>
  ```
* Delete multiple runs:

  ```
  gh run list --workflow <workflow_file.yml> --json databaseId -q '.[].databaseId' | xargs -n1 gh run delete
  ```

---

Replace placeholders such as \<run\_id>, \<workflow\_file.yml>, <branch>, and <path> with actual values. Use `--help` with any `gh` command for additional options.
